## About me ðŸ‘‹
Greetings! I'm JosÃ© Ribamar, a technology enthusiast with experience in software development. Specializing in FrontEnd, I use technology in my daily life such as React, Flutter, Docker, HTML5, CSS and React Native. Always looking for new projects and extracting the most for my personal growth. I believe in the power of collaboration and am always willing to learn and grow as a developer.
